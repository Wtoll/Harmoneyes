//! # Battery
//! 
//! ## Hardware
//! The Adafruit Feather nRF52840 has an on-board voltage regulator that
//! will automatically charge the battery when the USB port is powered
//! and will convert the battery voltage to a stable 3.3V for the
//! microcontroller.
//! 
//! There is also an analog input pin that is dedicated to being a
//! voltage monitor for the battery. In between the battery and the pin,
//! however, is a dual 150kOhm resistor voltage divider meaning the
//! analog pin is only reading half of the actual battery voltage.
//! This is actually great for us because the ADC is limited to a
//! maximum value of 3.3V and lowering the minimum value we're
//! trying to read allows use to transduce the voltage at a greater
//! accuracy. 
//! 
//! The lithium polymer batteries that are being have a known voltage
//! range of about 4.2V to 3.2V.
//! 
//! ### ADC
//! 
//! The analog to digital converter has a variety of configurations,
//! but in this case it's been configured to use a reference voltage
//! of 2.4V (just above 4.2V / 2) to maximize the ADC range, and a
//! 12-bit resolution.
//! 
//! ## Battery Testing
//!  
//! In testing it was found that the on-board voltage regulator will
//! turn off when the battery voltage (ADC * 2) crosses below a threshold
//! of about 3.3V and will stop charging when the battery voltage
//! crosses above a threshold of about 4.2V
